        <h3><p> 
            <b><h3>Ingredients</h3></b><br>
            <b><h4>Dough</h4></b>
            1 cup all purpose flour maida, plain flour<br>
            ¼ tsp salt<br>
            2 Tbsp oil canola, or vegetable<br>
            ¼ cup cold water more or less as needed<br>
            <h4><b>Filling</h4></b>
            ¼ cup washed moong dal, yellow<br>
            1 tsp fennel seeds coarsely ground saunf<br>
            1 tsp red chilly flakes<br>
            ¼ tsp ginger powder saunth<br>
            ½ tsp mango powder amchoor<br>
            ⅛ tsp asafetida hing<br>
            ½ tsp salt<br>
            2 Tbsp water<br><br>

            <h4><b>Making Dough</h4></b>

             Mix the flour, salt and oil. Add the chilled water slowly, mixing with your fingers as you pour. Do not knead the dough. The dough should be soft. Cover the dough and let it sit for at least fifteen minutes.
            <h4><b>Filling</h4></b>
            Grind the moong dal dry, almost to a powder.
            Mix one tablespoon of oil to the ground dal in a frying pan and roast over medium heat for about two to three minutes or until dal changes color slightly. Stir continuously. Turn off the heat. Add all the spices mix well. Let the mixture cool off. Add two tablespoons of warm water and mix it well. Let it sit for ten minutes and cover with demp cloth.
            <h4><b>Making Kachories</h4></b>
            Take the dough and knead it for a minutes. Divide the dough in twelve equal parts.
            Take one part of the dough and with your fingers flatten the edges and make into 3-inch circle. Leaving center little thicker then edges. Mold the dough into a cup and place 1 teaspoon of filling in the center. Pull the edges of the dough to wrap the dal filling. Proceed to make all 12 balls.
            Let the filled ball sit for three to four minutes before rolling.
            Set the kachoris on a surface with the seams facing up. Using the base of your palm, slowly flatten them into about three inches in diameter.
            Heat the oil in frying pan over medium heat frying pan should have about one inch of oil. To check if oil is ready put a little piece of dough in the oil. Dough should sizzle, and come up very slow.
            Fry them on medium-low heat. After they start to puff, slowly turn them over. Fry until golden-brown on both sides. If the kachoris are fried on high heat, they will get soft and will not be crispy.
            Kachories can be stored for at least a week in an airtight container.<br><br><br>

            <hr><a name="matarpaneer"><h2><li>Matar Paneer</li></h2></a><br>
        <h3><p> 
            <b><h3>Ingredients</h3></b><br>
                Paneer (Indian cottage cheese) <br>
                Vegetables<br>
                Cashews: Cashews act as a creamy thickener for the masala paste. However, if you do not have cashews on hand, you can substitute almonds.<br>
                Spices, Herbs and Seasonings: You will need several seasonings and spices for this mutter paneer recipe, including cumin seeds, turmeric powder, red chili powder, garam masala powder, salt, ginger, garlic, coriander leaves and seeds, black peppercorns, cardamom, cloves and cinnamon.<br>

                <h4><b>How to Make Matar Paneer Recipe</b></h4><br>
                1. First, you will take all of the masala paste ingredients and add them to a grinder or a blender. Make sure you include:<br>

                ½ cup chopped onions<br>
                ¾ to 1 cup chopped tomatoes<br>
                1 teaspoon chopped ginger {sub with ¼ teaspoon of ground ginger (dry ginger powder)}<br>
                1 teaspoon chopped garlic <br>
                10 to 12 cashews<br>
                2 tablespoons coriander leaves (cilantro)<br>
                1 teaspoon chopped green chilies or serrano peppers<br>
                4 to 5 black peppercorns<br>
                1 inch cinnamon (Use true cinnamon. For cassia cinnamon, use ½ inch of it)<br>
                1 teaspoon of coriander seeds {sub with 1 teaspoon of ground coriander (coriander powder)}<br>
                1 green cardamom - optional<br>
                2 cloves<br>

                2. After that, you will grind the ingredients into a smooth paste. If needed add 2 to 3 tablespoons of water while grinding the masala paste. When the paste is creamy and blended to a fine consistency, set aside until later.<br>

                3. Next add 3 tablespoons oil in a 2-litre pressure cooker or a pot. Let the oil become hot. Reduce heat to a medium-low heat. Add ½ teaspoon cumin seeds and fry until they splutter.<br>

                4. Next, add in your ground masala paste, and mix well.<br>

                5. Now you will sauté the paste mixture for about 10 to 12 minutes on a medium-low heat.<br>

                6. After sautéing the masala paste, add in all of the dry spice powders, stir to combine well and sauté for a minute. Be sure to include:
                <br>
                ¼ teaspoon turmeric powder<br>
                ½ teaspoon kashmiri red chili powder or sweet paprika (sub with ¼ to ½ teaspoon of cayenne or red chilli powder)
                <br>
                ¼ to ½ teaspoon garam masala powder (replace with ¼ teaspoon of curry powder)
                <br>
                7. Next, add in 1 cup of rinsed green peas or matar. You can chose to add either frozen or fresh green peas.
                <br>
                8. Mix again well.
                <br>
                9. Then, add 1 to 1.25 cups water, salt and mix thoroughly.
                <br>
                10. It’s now time to pressure cook the green peas until they are fully cooked. Be sure to cover the cooker tightly, then cook for about 9 to 10 minutes or 2 to 3 whistles on medium to medium-high heat.
                <br>
                11. Finally, add the paneer cubes and mix well or simmer on a low heat for a few seconds or until the paneer cubes are fully cooked. Don’t overcook as the paneer will become dense and hard.
                <br>
                12. Now that your matar paneer is ready to eat, garnish with chopped coriander leaves and serve hot or warm.

            <b><h3>Ingredients</h3></b><br>
            Black tea powder<br>
            Water<br>
            Milk<br>
            Sugar<br>
            Spices and herbs<br><br>

            <b>Spices and Herbs I Add</b><br>
            Cinnamon <br>
            Cloves <br>
            Green Cardamom<br> 
            Ginger <br><br>


            <h4><b>How to Make Masala Chai Recipe</b></h4><br>
            Crush The Masala (Spices)<br>
            1. Add 1 inch cinnamon, 2 to 3 green cardamoms, 2 cloves and 1-inch peeled ginger to a mortar-pestle. Use true cinnamon and not cassia cinnamon.
            <br>
            2. Crush coarsely with the pestle and set aside. But make sure that the ginger is flattened and crushed well. Alternatively choose to grate the ginger and add the spices whole or crushed.
            <br>
            3. Using a saucepan or small pan with a handle, heat 2 cups of water (500 ml).
            <br>
            4. Let the water come to a boil and add the crushed spices. If required, add a generous pinch of nutmeg powder to the spices. Either mint leaves or lemongrass can also be added at this step.
            <br>
            5. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add sugar to taste. I usually add 4 teaspoons of raw sugar. Some people prefer a very sweet tea. So you can increase the amount of sugar according to your taste preferences and also on the type and quality of sugar you are using.
            <br>
            6. Now add 2 teaspoons of Assam tea powder or tea dust. Boil for 1 minute. This boiling time depends on how strong you want your tea. If you prefer a deeper and stronger brew, then simmer for a few more minutes. But this can make the tea have some bitter notes.
            <br>
            7. Add ¼ cup of milk (at room temperature or cold). You may add more milk if required.
            <br>
            8. After adding milk boil for 2 to 3 minutes. If using chilled milk, boil for 2 to 3 minutes. If using hot milk, then add the milk and switch off the heat.
            <br>
            9. Pour the masala tea through a tea strainer directly into a cup.
            <br>
            10. Serve Masala Chai steaming hot with Indian snacks of your choice such as aloo pakora, veg cutlet, samosa, aloo tikki, onion pakoda, bread pakora, medu vada, biscuits or cookies.
